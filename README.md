# Python Practice Scripts

This repository contains various Python scripts written to practice and learn different concepts in Python programming. Each script focuses on a specific topic or technique. Below is a brief overview of each script along with its functionality.

## Scripts

### Py_comma_code
Adds commas between items in a list and includes 'and' before the last item. Useful for formatting lists into a human-readable string.

### Py_dict
A first attempt at working with dictionaries. Demonstrates basic dictionary operations such as creation, access, and modification.

### Py_element_list
Takes input, calculates the factorial, counts the number of elements, and lists them. Combines list operations with factorial calculation to enhance understanding.

### Py_for_loop
A basic introduction to for loops. Demonstrates syntax and practical usage of for loops in Python.

### Py_list_modifier
First experience with lists; takes user input and appends it to a list. Showcases basic list operations.

### Py_list_palindrome
Clones a list provided by the user and checks whether it is a palindrome. Useful for understanding list manipulation and palindrome logic.

### Py_multiplication_table_for_loop
Uses a for loop to print out the multiplication table of a number up to 10. Illustrates the use of loops for repetitive tasks.

### Py_multiplication_table_while_loop
Uses a while loop to print out the multiplication table of a number up to 10. Demonstrates the difference between for and while loops in Python.

### Py_recursion
Illustrates recursion by calling a user-defined function within itself. Highlights the concept and usage of recursive functions.

### Py_sets_dict_Q1_Q2
Contains solutions to Q1 and Q2 from ApnaCollage about sets and dictionaries. Explores set operations and dictionary usage in practical scenarios.

### Py_sets_dict_Q3_Q4
Contains solutions to Q3 and Q4 from ApnaCollage about sets and dictionaries. Continues the exploration of set and dictionary functionalities.

### Py_sets
A first attempt at working with sets. Demonstrates basic set operations such as creation, addition, and removal of elements.

### Py_sum_n_number_for_loop
Calculates the sum of `n` numbers using a for loop. Provides a practical example of loop-based summation.

### Py_sum_n_number_while_loop
Calculates the sum of `n` numbers using a while loop. Offers an alternative approach to loop-based summation.

### Py_tuple_count
First experience with tuples; counts the number of 'A' repetitions in the tuple. Demonstrates tuple operations and element counting.

### Py_list_ordering
Clones a list and orders it in ascending order. Useful for understanding list sorting and cloning techniques.

### Py_usd_to_pkr
Converts USD to PKR and vice versa based on user input. Demonstrates basic currency conversion logic and user input handling.
